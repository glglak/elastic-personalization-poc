# Elasticsearch Content Personalization POC

A proof of concept in .NET Core 8 that demonstrates how to implement a personalized content feed based on user interactions with Elasticsearch and a relational database for content actions.

## 🔍 Overview

This proof of concept demonstrates how to create a personalized content feed by leveraging:

- Elasticsearch for efficient content search and scoring
- SQL Server for storing user interactions
- Configurable personalization weights for different user actions

The system personalizes content based on a hierarchy of user interactions:

1. Share actions (highest weight)
2. Comment actions 
3. Like actions
4. Follow relationships
5. User preferences
6. User interests (lowest weight)

## 🏗️ Architecture

The architecture follows a clean, layered approach:

- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for content, personalization, and user interactions
- **Core Layer**: Domain entities, interfaces, and business models
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Service implementations and data access
- **Data Stores**: SQL Server for user interactions and Elasticsearch for content indexing

## 🚀 Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/glglak/elastic-personalization-poc.git
cd elastic-personalization-poc

# Start the services and initialize the environment
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The script will:
1. Start SQL Server, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and the API
2. Initialize the SQL Server database with sample data
3. Create and populate the Elasticsearch index

Once complete, you can access:
- API: http://localhost:5000
- Kibana: http://localhost:5601

## 🔧 Project Structure

The project follows a clean architecture pattern with the following components:

- **ElasticPersonalization.Core**: Contains domain entities, interfaces, and business logic
- **ElasticPersonalization.Infrastructure**: Contains implementations of repositories and services
- **ElasticPersonalization.API**: Contains API controllers and configuration
